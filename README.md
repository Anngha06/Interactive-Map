# Interactive India Map (React + Vite)

This is a minimal React application that renders an interactive 2D map of India.

Small markers are placed on important cities / states. When you click a marker, a details panel on the right shows information for that location.

## How to run

1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open the folder in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cd interactive-india-map
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

You can edit the markers in `src/data/locations.js` (add / remove states, change text, move positions, etc.).
